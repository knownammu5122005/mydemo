	 <p>Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore,<br>
	 and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially <br>
	 focused on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such <br>
	 as consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.<br>
     The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.<br><br> As of
	 FY23, Flipkart held a 48% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry. Flipkart has<br>
	 a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra,<br>
	 and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics and<br>
